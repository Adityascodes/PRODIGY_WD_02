Hello Everyone!!

Excited to share my latest Task-02 as a web developer intern! Tasked by the Prodigy InfoTech. I crafted a sophisticated stopwatch()web app using HTML, CSS and JAVASCRIPT. where HTML structuring the elements, CSS adding style, and JAVSCRIPT delivering interactivity. From starting, pausing, restarting and reset the stopwatch and to displaying and reset the lap times, every feature has been carefully implemented to ensure accuracy and usability.
